It provides a common file system that multiple compute instances, including EC2, containerized applications, and on-premises servers, can access simultaneously. 

High Throughput & Low Latency:
EFS is designed to support applications requiring high throughput and low-latency access to data.

As a fully managed service, AWS handles the underlying infrastructure, allowing you to focus on your applications.
