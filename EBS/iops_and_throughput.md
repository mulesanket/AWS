- IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second)

Definition:
Number of read/write operations that can be performed in one second.
Each "operation" = a single I/O request (typically 4 KB in size for SSDs).
Think of IOPS as how many “transactions” (small reads/writes) per second your disk can handle.

Example:
If an EBS volume supports 3,000 IOPS, it means it can handle 3,000 random reads/writes of 4 KB blocks in one second.

Analogy:
Imagine a bank ATM — IOPS = number of customers served per second.
More IOPS → more small requests served quickly.

- Throughput (MB/s or GiB/s)

Definition:
The amount of data transferred per second.
Measured in MB/s (megabytes per second).
Think of throughput as how much bulk data per second your disk can move.

Example:
If throughput = 500 MB/s, the disk can read/write 500 megabytes every second (good for large sequential files).

Analogy:
Imagine a water pipe — throughput = how much water flows through per second.
Bigger pipe → more data flow.

Real-World Examples
1. Database (MySQL/PostgreSQL)

Each query may touch thousands of small rows randomly.
Needs high IOPS (fast random reads/writes).
Example: gp3 with 8,000 IOPS provisioned.

2. Big Data Analytics (Hadoop, Spark, Data Warehouse)

Deals with huge files (GBs/TBs) scanned sequentially.
Needs high throughput (move GBs quickly).
Needs throughput, not IOPS.

Example: st1 with 500 MB/s throughput.
