📌 Amazon S3 Storage Classes – Detailed Notes for Interview
1. S3 Standard

Default class – used when you don’t explicitly set a storage class.

Durability: 99.999999999% (11 nines) – virtually zero chance of data loss.

Availability: 99.99% across 3+ Availability Zones.

Retrieval time: Milliseconds.

Cost: Highest among classes (but justified for frequently accessed data).

🔹 Use cases:

Static website hosting (HTML, JS, CSS).

Mobile app content (images, videos).

Real-time log analytics.

🔹 Interview Tip: Say “I would use S3 Standard for hot data that my application or users access frequently, where latency and high availability are critical.”
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. S3 Intelligent-Tiering

Designed for data with unpredictable or unknown access patterns.

Automatically moves objects between tiers:

Frequent Access

Infrequent Access

Archive Instant Access

Monitoring fee (per 1,000 objects).

Retrieval is milliseconds, regardless of tier.

No retrieval charges in the frequent tier, but yes in IA/Archive tier.

🔹 Use cases:

Data lakes with mixed access.

Media libraries where some files are accessed daily, some rarely.

🔹 Interview Tip: “If I don’t know access patterns upfront, Intelligent-Tiering helps reduce cost without me setting lifecycle rules manually.”
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)

Durability: 11 nines across multiple AZs.

Availability: 99.9%.

Retrieval time: Milliseconds.

Cost: Cheaper storage than Standard, but retrieval fee applies.

🔹 Use cases:

Monthly financial reports.

Long-lived but occasionally accessed project files.

Disaster recovery datasets.

🔹 Interview Tip: “I’d use Standard-IA for data that isn’t hot, but still must be retrieved instantly when needed, like compliance data accessed once in a while.”
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA)

Same as Standard-IA, but stored in only one AZ.

Durability: 11 nines, but no multi-AZ resilience.

Availability: 99.5%.

Cost: 20% cheaper than Standard-IA.

Retrieval: Milliseconds.

🔹 Use cases:

Re-creatable data (e.g., transcoded video, cache dumps).

Secondary backups.

🔹 Interview Tip: “If cost is important and I can tolerate AZ failure risk, I’d pick One Zone-IA. For critical data, I’ll stick with Standard-IA.”
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval

Archive class for rarely accessed but must be retrieved instantly.

Durability: 11 nines.

Availability: 99.9%.

Retrieval: Milliseconds.

Cost: Much lower than Standard-IA, but retrieval fee applies.

🔹 Use cases:

Medical images (X-rays, MRIs).

Old media assets (videos, photos).

🔹 Interview Tip: “This is for archival workloads where instant retrieval is mandatory. For example, hospital records need to be instantly available even if rarely accessed.”
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval (formerly Glacier)

Low-cost archive storage.

Retrieval time options:

Expedited: 1–5 min (extra fee).

Standard: 3–5 hrs.

Bulk: 5–12 hrs.

Durability: 11 nines.

Availability: 99.99%.

🔹 Use cases:

Long-term archives.

Disaster recovery backups.

Regulatory documents that must be retained for years.

🔹 Interview Tip: “I’d use Flexible Retrieval if I need archival at the lowest cost but can wait hours for access. Example: 5-year-old audit logs.”
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. S3 Glacier Deep Archive

Cheapest S3 storage class.

Durability: 11 nines.

Availability: 99.99%.

Retrieval time: 12–48 hours.

Designed for 7–10 years retention.

🔹 Use cases:

Government compliance archives.

Financial/legal records.

Historical data preservation.

🔹 Interview Tip: “Deep Archive is ideal for data we may never access, but must retain for compliance, like tax or medical records for 7 years.”
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8. S3 Express One Zone (Newest)

High-performance, single-AZ storage class.

Lowest latency (sub-millisecond).

Optimized for latency-sensitive workloads.

Trade-off: No multi-AZ durability.

🔹 Use cases:

High-frequency trading.

Real-time AI/ML inference.

Low-latency content delivery.

🔹 Interview Tip: “I’d use Express One Zone if milliseconds matter more than multi-AZ durability, e.g., in financial trading systems.”
